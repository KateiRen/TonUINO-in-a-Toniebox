- The jumper wires needed some glue to stay in place while moving the components.
- The inner parts needed some tooling to make more space for the new RFID reader.
- The surface where the Tonies originally are placed on was stripped of its metallic layer to allow RFID communication with the smaller new reader.

In order to access the SD card without opening the box, we need to access the USB- and USB+ lines of the DFMini player. Unfortunately that is not part of the PCB design.
