## Why?

I love the simplicity and ruggedized/soft enclosure of [Toniebox](https://tonies.de/toniebox/). However, as a closed system it has some drawbacks like the limited playtime per tonie not to mention the price per tonie and the price of the base system.

On the other hand, [tonUINO](https://www.tonuino.de/) seems to provide the perfect alternative for hobbyists with a soldering iron and some knowledge of electronics.

So the idea was born to build a [tonUINO](https://www.tonuino.de/) inside the enclosure of a [Toniebox](https://tonies.de/toniebox/). I bought a malfunctioning box on ebay put it in a drawer and - almost a year later ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ - started to implement the idea. 


## Features

The box builds on the three button version of [tonUINO](https://www.tonuino.de/), using the "ears" as Volume down/previous Track and Volume up/next Track. Play/Pause has been added as a little push button along with a power switch.

The box runs on its own with a built in LiPo battery and a charging battery shield. 

Charging and easy access to the SD-Card is possible through a single micro USB port at te bottom.

## What's inside

To get the best formfactor possible, I used the official PCB with jumper wires to establish connections.
