# Why?

I love teh simplicity and ruggedized/soft enclosure of Toniebox. However, as a closed system it has some drawbacks like the limited playtime per tonie not to mention the price per tonie and the price of the base system.

On the other hand, tonUINO seems to provide the perfect alternative for hobbyists with a soldering iron and some knowledge of electronics.
